# -fixinator

Given a list of names, find the most common prefixes and suffixes. For names and stuff.

## Installation

Clone and install with Yarn.

If I have given you the `data.json` file, put it in `./data`. Then run `yarn start` to
generate the prefix file and name list.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Data files

If I have not given you the `data.json` file (permissions stuff, sorry), you
can write your own using the following structure:

```
[
  {
    "race": "x",
    "given": [
      "name
    ]
  }
]
```
